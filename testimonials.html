                            <blockquote>Thank you so much Kate for a fantastic & hugely insightful course. The timing was amazing for me and this has been an opportunity for self reflection & development. The meditations were extremely relaxing and a great way to let go of things that are no longer useful.<br><br>

                                The tips and exercises were incredibly useful and empowering and I feel that I have more tools in my emotional wellbeing toolkit as a result of this course. Thank you so much for the opportunity and I would highly recommend this course.

                                Having previously only done very limited meditation, I am now using it as a regular relaxation technique.<br><br>
                                The tool box you have provided me with means I now can see things in a different light and am able to handle things different.
